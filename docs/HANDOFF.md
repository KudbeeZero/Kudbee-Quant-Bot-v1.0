# HANDOFF — the baton

> Updated by `/closeout` at the end of each chat; read by `/handoff-audit` (and
> the SessionStart hook) at the start of the next. See `docs/SESSION_PROTOCOL.md`.
> Keep this SHORT — it's a baton, not a log. History lives in git + `docs/audits/`.

## Current baton

- **Protocol status:** `ACTIVE`.
- **Last branch:** `claude/pr-14-handoff-audit-gpo9ab`
- **Last PR:** #15 — https://github.com/KudbeeZero/Kudbee-Quant-Bot-v1.0/pull/15
  (PR #14 audit gate record + baton reconciliation; docs-only).
- **Audit status:** `AWAITING_AUDIT`.
- PR #14 is CLOSED OUT: **`MERGED (audit PASS)`** at `3cb9001` (audit-gated merge
  2026-06-14; report: `docs/audits/pr-14-audit.md` — independent arm's-length
  subagent in an isolated worktree + in-session cross-check, 254/254, all 10
  claims diff-verified, live gate verified incapable of placing an order, no
  forbidden-file changes, CI + Cloudflare Pages green, `mergeable_state` clean).
  Gate streak: #5, #6, #7, #9, #11, #12, #13, #14.

## What this chat did (for the auditor to verify against the diff)

- **PR #14 audit gate → PASS, merged** at `3cb9001`: independent arm's-length
  subagent (isolated git worktree, no authoring context) **+** in-session
  cross-check vs the real `c2bf507..d295eed` diff (top-100 1h foundation +
  review skills + gated/stub live execution). 254/254 (210 prior + 44 new), all
  10 claims diff-verified, **live executor verified incapable of placing an
  order** (can't construct without both opt-in flags; `submit()` raises), no
  secrets, no `data/journal.json` / `data/alert_inbox/` changes, proven top-10
  hourly book untouched (`paper-trade.yml` not in diff). Report:
  `docs/audits/pr-14-audit.md`. Baton reconciled.
- **This PR (#15) is docs-only** — the audit report + this baton update. No
  product code; the next auditor's diff should be just
  `docs/audits/pr-14-audit.md` + `docs/HANDOFF.md`.

## NEXT chat

- **Slug hint (ADVISORY only):** `claude/live-order-placement` — harness assigns
  the real name; the *scope* below is what binds.
- **Scope (user-confirmed 2026-06-13/14):** **Live order-placement subsystem** —
  the real exchange client behind the existing `require_live_enabled()` gate (PR
  #14 shipped the gated stub). Authenticated venue client (ccxt / Binance), order
  submit/cancel/poll, balance + `MAX_DAILY_LOSS_USD` kill-switch, order-id ↔
  journal mapping (fill `exchange_order_id`/`filled_at` from the venue, not bar
  time). KEEP paper as the default; live stays double-gated. Honor §1 / `FEE_PCT`.
- **Also queued from PR #14:** (a) decide whether to flip the hourly Action to the
  top-100 universe (opt-in; 10× API load, floods the bot-owned journal — see
  `docs/TOP100_1H_UNIVERSE.md`); (b) the **Execution Lab** (TP1 partial-banking
  re-sim over saved signals via the shared resolver — §35 autopsy) is still open
  and low-risk if you want a research turn instead of live wiring.
- **FIRST (carryover): verify the 5m pause landed** — confirm the hourly Action
  logs NO new `5m` signals (§37 still unverified in production).
- **Live deploy walkthrough (also queued):** once the user creates the Render
  service (`docs/HOSTING.md`), smoke-test the live host — health, dashboard, a
  real `/api/alert` with `"inbox": true`, the alert commit appearing in
  `data/alert_inbox/` and ingested by the next hourly run.
- **Open risks / watch-items:**
  - **Live execution DOES NOT EXIST yet (PR #14):** `LiveExecutor` is a gated stub
    that raises; the real order path is the next PR. Nothing can trade real money.
  - **Top-100 membership UNPROVEN forward (§31):** only the top-10 majors are
    walk-forward validated; the long tail in `config/crypto_universe.yaml` is a
    static fallback snapshot, forward-test only. The hourly Action still runs top-10.
  - **5m pause UNVERIFIED in production (§37):** the workflow edit was tested
    locally (YAML + 254/254) but not yet confirmed on the hourly Action — confirm
    the next run logs no new 5m signals.
  - **Deployment UNPROVEN:** render.yaml + inbox tested locally only; no live
    Render service exists yet (user action: create Blueprint via `docs/HOSTING.md`;
    set `KUDBEE_API_TOKEN` / `KUDBEE_SITE_ORIGIN` / `KUDBEE_GH_TOKEN`).
  - **Possible edge decay on 1h crypto book** (§36 addendum: orig −91.9R / fade
    +89.8R over ~4 months OOS; §37 check: only −2R/2 trades since 06-12, too small
    to read) — re-check as forward data accrues before action.
  - **Branch deletions pending (user action, §32):** safe to delete via GitHub UI:
    handoff-audit-hvuuab, hello-1lje1b, overnight-algo-research-plan-hyqzf6,
    sol-short-position-0eytax, fable-5-release-review-mow58s,
    handoff-audit-fee-scoring-p0yg4n, handoff-audit-xtn2bz,
    zcash-backtest-orderbook-shjg5o (salvage PR #9 merged).
  - **Accepted disclosures (HOSTING.md):** public `/api/metrics`, `?token=`
    supported for TV compatibility.
  - **§33:** replay pct ≠ live-edge pct — never use a replay's confluence pct
    to re-verify the entry gate; caveat ships in every replay response/CLI footer.
  - **§31:** 11 added TradFi symbols UNPROVEN forward; watch softs.
  - **§29/§30 standing caveats** + maker-vs-taker fee contradiction (one real
    LIMIT fill settles it); scorecard still not an edge readout.
- **Off-limits:** validated strategy defaults (§1) and `FEE_PCT`;
  `data/journal.json` (bot-owned — no session commits); **`data/alert_inbox/`
  (host+Action-owned — no manual session commits there either)**; crypto
  daily grouping stays calendar-dated; held salvage branches only with explicit
  user OK.

## Baton history

- `BOOTSTRAP` — relay protocol introduced (PR #2).
- `2026-06-09` — PR #2 merged from UI pre-audit; post-hoc audit PASS. Protocol
  hardened on `claude/handoff-audit-xtn2bz`: baton hands off scope (not a branch
  name), `/handoff-audit` checks real PR state + post-hoc path, status reconciled.
- `2026-06-10` — PR #4 merged (user-authorized, CI green): net-of-fee scoring (§26
  DONE) + protocol hardening. Duplicate PR #3 closed as superseded (§28). Next scope:
  TradFi session/RTH level verification.
- `2026-06-10` — PR #5 opened (`claude/fable-5-release-review-mow58s`): PR #4
  post-hoc audit PASS + TradFi session fixes (§29) — stub-day levels, Yahoo tick
  row, pending false-fills; 183 tests.
- `2026-06-10` — PR #5 **audited (PASS) and merged** by `claude/handoff-audit-hvuuab`
  (gate held). §28 recurred: that chat's duplicate trade-date fix reverted as
  superseded (§30). PR #6 opened (docs-only). Next scope: `_tradfi` taint audit +
  universe expansion (+11 assets); Jarvis dashboard queued after.
- `2026-06-11` — PR #6 **audited (PASS) and merged** at `dd809c9` by
  `claude/hello-1lje1b` (gate held again). Blemish: §30 Monday-flip lower bound
  ~33%, not 40%.

  API fields, XSS escaping) + §32; TV-webhook scope then PULLED FORWARD into
  the same PR (user-directed, disclosed in the PR body) — `/api/alert` made
  TV-usable + `source="human"`. 191 tests. Next scope: hosting.

  mid-session — next scope: audit + land BOTH, #9 first, resolve conflicts.
- `2026-06-12` — PR #11 opened (`claude/handoff-audit-tradingview-6sswe1`):
  PR #9 gate report + hosting unit (Render Starter blueprint + TV alert inbox,
